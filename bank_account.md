# Bank Account From Hell

## Description

Building out the basics of a CLI banking system.
You can set up your own account, do all the functions of an ATM (Deposit, withdraw, transfer, display account)

## Function
Download the code to your computer, open the file inside your prefered IDE. All the code is written in Python. In the terminal run `python3 atm.py`. This will start the banking CLI game in your terminal.

## Learned lessons

I like match case conditionals.
Why can't I use methods inside the same class, or run methods inside the constructor.
Shallow/Deep copies are fascinating, need to learn more about how they work. 
Making classes effectively communicate is not as straightforward as I would think.
